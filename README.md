# SelQA: Selection-based Question Answering

The SelQA dataset provides crowdsourced annotation for two selection-based question answer tasks, answer sentence selection and answer triggering.
Our dataset composes about 8K factoid questions for the top-10 most prevalent topics among Wikipedia articles.
Our study illustrates that question answering systems trained on SelQA show nearly as robust results as ones trained on a much larger dataset such as [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).
