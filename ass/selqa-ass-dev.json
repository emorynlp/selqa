December 1940, both during daylight hours and at night.", "Although most of these raids were unproductive, there were some successes; on 1 August, five out of 12 Blenheims sent to attack Haamstede and

was killed on another operation), the other 11, which reached Denmark, were shot down, five by flak and six by Bf 109s.", "Of the 33 crewmen who took part in the attack, 20 were killed and 13 captured.", "As well as the bombing operations, Blenheim-equipped units had been formed to carry out long-range strategic reconnaissance missions over Germany and German-occupied territories.", "In

of British shipping, and the destruction of enemy shipping.", "As invasion became more likely, it participated in the strikes on French harbours and airfields, laying mines, and mounting numerous
