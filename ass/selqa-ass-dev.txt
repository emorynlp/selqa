What is the Hockney - Falco postulation ?	In 2001 , British artist David Hockney published the book " Secret Knowledge : Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters " , in which he argued that Vermeer - among other Renaissance artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Velázquez - used optics , and specifically some combination of curved mirrors , camera obscura and camera lucida , to achieve precise positioning in their compositions .	1
What is the Hockney - Falco postulation ?	This became known as the Hockney – Falco thesis , named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco , another proponent of the theory .	0
What is the Hockney - Falco postulation ?	Working independently , in 2001 British architecture professor Philip Steadman published the book " Vermeer 's Camera : Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces " , which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings .	0
What is the Hockney - Falco postulation ?	Noting that many of Vermeer 's paintings had been painted in the same room , Steadman found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room 's back wall .	0
What is the Hockney - Falco postulation ?	Supporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer 's paintings , such as the often - discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer 's paintings , which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing halation .	0

Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	This can occur in three main ways .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	First , bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment , in a process called transformation .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Genes can also be transferred by the process of transduction , when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	The third method of gene transfer is conjugation , whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles , rather than a bacterial adaptation .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Conjugation , in the much - studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes , and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome , and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Plasmid - mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Transformation , unlike transduction or conjugation , depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process , and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	In order for a bacterium to bind , take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome , it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence ( see Natural competence ) .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	In " Bacillus subtilis " about 40 genes are required for the development of competence .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	The length of DNA transferred during " B. subtilis " transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species , and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions , and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions .	0
Gene transfer is important for what reasons ?	Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .	1

What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	racing ) , crew ability , point of sail , hull size & design .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	When a vessel is subject to a heeling force ( such as wind pressure ) , vessel buoyancy & beam of the hull will counter-act the heeling force .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	A weighted keel provides additional means to right the boat .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	In some high - performance racing yachts , water ballast or the angle of a canting keel can be changed to provide additional righting force to counteract heeling .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	The crew may move their personal weight to the high ( upwind ) side of the boat , this is called " hiking " , which also changes the centre of gravity & produces a righting lever to reduce the degree of heeling .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Incidental benefits include faster vessel speed caused by more efficient action of the hull & sails .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Other options to reduce heeling include reducing exposed sail area & efficiency of the sail setting & a variant of hiking called " trapezing " .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	This can only be done if the vessel is designed for this , as in dinghy sailing .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	A sailor can ( usually involuntarily ) try turning upwind in gusts ( it is known as " rounding up " ) .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	This can lead to difficulties in controlling the vessel if over-canvassed .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Wind can be spilled from the sails by ' sheeting out ' , or loosening them .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	The number of sails , their size and shape can be altered .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Raising the dinghy centreboard can reduce heeling by allowing more leeway .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	The increasingly asymmetric underwater shape of the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	The sails ' centre of effort will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel 's motion due to increasing lever effect with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction , so leading to an equilibrium state .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	As more heeling force causes more heel , weather helm may be experienced .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind therefore reducing the forces on the sail .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Small amounts ( ≤5 degrees ) of weather helm are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary of the reason why lee helm is dangerous .	0
What is the opposite of the weather helm ?	Lee helm , the opposite of weather helm , is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released , thus increasing forces on the sail at a time when the helmsperson is not in control .	1

When is a personal penalty issued ?	According to the current Rules of Hockey 2013 issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent ( what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment ) .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally , if somewhat inconsistently , applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch : it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5 m of the ball is certainly dangerous .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	The velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized , this is in the umpire 's discretion .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A jab tackle for example , might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be , in the opinion of the umpire , dangerous play .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	In the same way a high velocity hit at very close range into an opponent , but below knee height , could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire , especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5 m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground – a rule which is often only loosely applied ; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance , 2–3 m , and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it : these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire 's perception of the skill of the players i.e.	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	on the level of the game , in order to maintain game flow , which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do , by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so , this is also a matter in the umpire 's discretion .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	The term " falling ball " is important in what may be termed encroaching offences .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height ( although the height is not specified in rule ) and is falling .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	So , for example , a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line ( or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line ) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	In general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantage by it or , obviously , not injured by it so that he can not continue .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A personal penalty , that is a caution or a suspension , rather than a team penalty , such as a free ball or a penalty corner , may be ( many would say should be or even must be , but again this is in the umpire 's discretion ) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred , including dangerous play ( but once advantage has been allowed the umpire can not then call play back and award a team penalty ) .	1
When is a personal penalty issued ?	It is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent 's stick ( or body on the ground ) , provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	For example , a skillful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them , however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender 's body , this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	It is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so , as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	For example , two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time , would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so ' carrying ' it would be penalised .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	Dangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball , making a stroke at it ( replacing what was at one time referred to as the " sticks " rule , which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent ) or attempting to tackle , ( fouls relating to tripping , impeding and obstruction ) .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging , impeding and obstruction with the body , although these are also dealt with firmly , especially when these fouls are intentional : field hockey is a non-contact sport .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	Players may not play or attempt to play at the ball above their shoulders unless trying to save a shot that could go into the goal , in which case they are permitted to stop the ball or deflect it safely away .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	A swing , as in a hit , at a high shot at the goal ( or even wide of the goal ) will probably be considered dangerous play if at opponents within 5 m and such a stroke would be contrary to rule in these circumstances anyway .	0
When is a personal penalty issued ?	Within the English National League it is now a legal action to take a ball above shoulder height if completed using a controlled action .	0

How is IMRT technology limited ?	The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and / or MRI scanners and planning software .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Virtual simulation , the most basic form of planning , allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays , where soft - tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3 - dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3DCRT ) , in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam 's eye view ( BEV ) using a multileaf collimator ( MLC ) and a variable number of beams .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor , the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced , allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) is an advanced type of high - precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes , for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Computer - controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation ( Treatment Planning ) .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	The radiation dose is consistent with the 3 - D shape of the tumor by controlling , or modulating , the radiation beam ’s intensity .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissue is decreased or avoided completely .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	The customized radiation dose is intended to maximize tumor dose while simultaneously protecting the surrounding normal tissue .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	This may result in better tumor targeting , lessened side effects , and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS , head and neck , prostate , breast and lung .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Unfortunately , IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel .	1
How is IMRT technology limited ?	This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Then , medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Also , the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers , so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency program must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy ( 2DXRT ) is growing for many tumor sites , but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Both techniques enable dose escalation , potentially increasing usefulness .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	There has been some concern , particularly with IMRT , about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans ( and therefore not included in the treatment plan ) or that move between or during a treatment ( for example , due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization ) .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty — for example , real - time imaging combined with real - time adjustment of the therapeutic beams .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	This new technology is called image - guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) or four - dimensional radiation therapy .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	Another technique is the real - time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils , and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location .	0
How is IMRT technology limited ?	The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real - time tracking of the tumor position .	0
