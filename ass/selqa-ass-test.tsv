In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	They are defined by the set of light cones ( see the image on the left ) .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	The light - cones define a causal structure : for each event A , there is a set of events that can , in principle , either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light ( such as event B in the image ) , and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible ( such as event C in the image ) .	0

In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	In conjunction with the world - lines of freely falling particles , the light - cones can be used to reconstruct the space – time 's semi-Riemannian metric , at least up to a positive scalar factor .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	In mathematical terms , this defines a conformal structure .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity , so for practical applications , it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Bringing gravity into play , and assuming the universality of free fall , an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies : there are no global inertial frames .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Translated into the language of spacetime : the straight time - like lines that define a gravity - free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other , suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	A priori , it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold — that theory is based on the propagation of light , and thus on electromagnetism , which could have a different set of preferred frames .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	But using different assumptions about the special - relativistic frames ( such as their being earth - fixed , or in free fall ) , one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift , that is , the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field ( cf.	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	below ) .	0

In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Consequently , we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	The metric tensor that defines the geometry — in particular , how lengths and angles are measured — is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity , it is a generalization known as a semi - or pseudo-Riemannian metric .	0
In what type of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity ?	Furthermore , each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection , the Levi - Civita connection , and this is , in fact , the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian ( that is , in suitable locally inertial coordinates , the metric is Minkowskian , and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish ) .	0

Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	This can occur in three main ways .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	First , bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment , in a process called transformation .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Genes can also be transferred by the process of transduction , when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	The third method of gene transfer is conjugation , whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles , rather than a bacterial adaptation .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Conjugation , in the much - studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes , and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome , and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Plasmid - mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Transformation , unlike transduction or conjugation , depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process , and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	In order for a bacterium to bind , take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome , it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence ( see Natural competence ) .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	In " Bacillus subtilis " about 40 genes are required for the development of competence .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	The length of DNA transferred during " B. subtilis " transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species , and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions , and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions .	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance ?	Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .	1
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Since its inception , the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Even fundamental issues , such as Max Born 's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Richard Feynman once said , " I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics . "	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	According to Steven Weinberg , " There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	" The Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists , some 75 years after its enunciation .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	According to this interpretation , the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a " temporary " feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory , but instead must be considered a " final " renunciation of the classical idea of " causality " .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	It is also believed therein that any well - defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement , due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Albert Einstein , himself one of the founders of quantum theory , disliked this loss of determinism in measurement .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and , consequently , that the present theory was incomplete .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	He produced a series of objections to the theory , the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein – Podolsky – Rosen paradox .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	John Bell showed that this " EPR " paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics , thereby demonstrating that the physical world can not be described by any local realistic theory .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	The " Bohr - Einstein debates " provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	The Everett many - worlds interpretation , formulated in 1956 , holds that " all " the possibilities described by quantum theory " simultaneously " occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	This is not accomplished by introducing some " new axiom " to quantum mechanics , but on the contrary , by " removing " the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	" All " of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus ( including the observer ) are present in a " real " physical - not just formally mathematical , as in other interpretations - quantum superposition .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	While the multiverse is deterministic , we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities , because we can observe only the universe ( i.e. , the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition ) that we , as observers , inhabit .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Everett 's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell 's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	However , according to the theory of quantum decoherence , these " parallel universes " will never be accessible to us .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	The inaccessibility can be understood as follows : once a measurement is done , the measured system becomes entangled with " both " the physicist who measured it " and " a huge number of other particles , some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse , one would have to bring " all " these particles back and measure them again , together with the system that was originally measured .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Not only is this completely impractical , but even if one " could " theoretically do this , it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place ( to include the physicist 's memory !	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	) ; in light of these Bell tests , Cramer ( 1986 ) formulated his transactional interpretation .	0
When did relational quantum mechanics appear ?	Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the Copenhagen Interpretation .	1

What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	Based on studies in the fly " Drosophila melanogaster " , it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene , this will probably be harmful , with about 70 % of these mutations having damaging effects , and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated ( usually by genetic recombination ) , which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	For example , the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for colour vision and one for night vision ; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system ; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated , with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts , domains act as modules with simple independent functions , which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions .	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called ?	For example , polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics ; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process , like a step in an assembly line .	1

What is the function of genetic recombination ?	A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype .	0
What is the function of genetic recombination ?	This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial : natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population ; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft .	0
What is the function of genetic recombination ?	Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size .	0

What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	They are defined by the set of light cones ( see the image on the left ) .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	The light - cones define a causal structure : for each event A , there is a set of events that can , in principle , either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light ( such as event B in the image ) , and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible ( such as event C in the image ) .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	These sets are observer - independent .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	In conjunction with the world - lines of freely falling particles , the light - cones can be used to reconstruct the space – time 's semi-Riemannian metric , at least up to a positive scalar factor .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	In mathematical terms , this defines a conformal structure .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity , so for practical applications , it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Bringing gravity into play , and assuming the universality of free fall , an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies : there are no global inertial frames .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Translated into the language of spacetime : the straight time - like lines that define a gravity - free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other , suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	A priori , it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold — that theory is based on the propagation of light , and thus on electromagnetism , which could have a different set of preferred frames .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	But using different assumptions about the special - relativistic frames ( such as their being earth - fixed , or in free fall ) , one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift , that is , the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field ( cf.	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	below ) .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	The actual measurements show that free - falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity .	1
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	The generalization of this statement , namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling ( and non-rotating ) reference frames , is known as the Einstein equivalence principle , a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special - relativistic physics to include gravity .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field — proper time , to give the technical term — does not follow the rules of special relativity .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	In the language of spacetime geometry , it is not measured by the Minkowski metric .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	As in the Newtonian case , this is suggestive of a more general geometry .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	At small scales , all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent , and approximately Minkowskian .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Consequently , we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	The metric tensor that defines the geometry — in particular , how lengths and angles are measured — is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity , it is a generalization known as a semi - or pseudo-Riemannian metric .	0
What frames do light propogate like it does in special relativity ?	Furthermore , each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection , the Levi - Civita connection , and this is , in fact , the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian ( that is , in suitable locally inertial coordinates , the metric is Minkowskian , and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish ) .	0

Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Less common are closed circuit ( CCR ) and semi-closed ( SCR ) rebreathers , which unlike open - circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases , process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Rebreathers release little or no gas bubbles into the water , and use much less stored gas volume , for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered ; this has advantages for research , military , photography , and other applications .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open - circuit scuba , and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used , due to the larger variety of potential failure modes .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	In a closed - circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled , so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum , which reduces the inert gas ( nitrogen and / or helium ) partial pressure in the breathing loop .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver 's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real - time computer processing by the diver 's decompression computer .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and , as a result , divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop , or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume , so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver 's oxygen consumption and / or breathing rate .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR , but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems .	0
Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work ?	Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles , they do not disturb marine life or make a diver ’s presence known at the surface ; this is useful for underwater photography , and for covert work .	1

In Newtonian physics , all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent , and approximately what ?	Translated into the language of spacetime : the straight time - like lines that define a gravity - free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other , suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry .	0
In Newtonian physics , all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent , and approximately what ?	A priori , it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold — that theory is based on the propagation of light , and thus on electromagnetism , which could have a different set of preferred frames .	0

What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and / or MRI scanners and planning software .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Virtual simulation , the most basic form of planning , allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays , where soft - tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3 - dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3DCRT ) , in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam 's eye view ( BEV ) using a multileaf collimator ( MLC ) and a variable number of beams .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor , the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced , allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) is an advanced type of high - precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes , for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Computer - controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation ( Treatment Planning ) .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The radiation dose is consistent with the 3 - D shape of the tumor by controlling , or modulating , the radiation beam ’s intensity .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissue is decreased or avoided completely .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The customized radiation dose is intended to maximize tumor dose while simultaneously protecting the surrounding normal tissue .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	This may result in better tumor targeting , lessened side effects , and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS , head and neck , prostate , breast and lung .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Unfortunately , IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel .	1
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Then , medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Also , the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers , so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency program must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy ( 2DXRT ) is growing for many tumor sites , but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Both techniques enable dose escalation , potentially increasing usefulness .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	There has been some concern , particularly with IMRT , about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans ( and therefore not included in the treatment plan ) or that move between or during a treatment ( for example , due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization ) .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty — for example , real - time imaging combined with real - time adjustment of the therapeutic beams .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	This new technology is called image - guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) or four - dimensional radiation therapy .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	Another technique is the real - time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils , and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location .	0
What is the limitation of IMRT technology ?	The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real - time tracking of the tumor position .	0

Where do mutations occur ?	Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	For example , the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for colour vision and one for night vision ; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system ; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated , with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts , domains act as modules with simple independent functions , which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions .	0
Where do mutations occur ?	For example , polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics ; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process , like a step in an assembly line .	0
